We started GoodRx to make prescription pricing and healthcare more transparent
Like most Americans, I thought a job that provided health insurance would let me access quality healthcare at a reasonable price. And then I got sick.

Even with insurance, the prescription I needed cost $450 at my regular pharmacy. I decided to check another pharmacy: It was $250 there. A third pharmacy told me $400. Every pharmacy had a different price and they were all outrageous.

I learned two things that day: For one, having insurance doesn't guarantee you affordable care. And secondly, that I could compare prices online for everything but prescriptions.

We started GoodRx to solve both of those problems. We wanted a way for consumers — insured or not — to sort through our confusing, frustrating, and expensive healthcare system. And find the treatment they need at a price they can afford.
